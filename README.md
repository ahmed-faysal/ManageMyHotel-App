# ManageMyHotel-App
A simple yet quite compact hotel management desktop application I developed for my C# project.

::Points to Note::

Admin has to be pre set in the database. No option given for admin registration because the anyone with Admin role is given master control.
Admin can add employees and manage almost everything.

For the database part I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Unfortunately I lost the database due to a system crash, and I am not willing to get back to this project and fill the gaps anymore.
If anyone wishes to checkout the project and take it forward, feel free. But first make sure to create a database in MSSQL server Management Studio.
